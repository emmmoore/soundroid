# Ideas
Add any and all ideas (simple or outlandish) that would make dealing with music and audio in Android apps easier, here!

* Basic play, pause, stop, replay, etc. features
* Ability to select an audio file
* Access to Spotify/Apple Music/etc.
* Scrubbing backwards and forwards through song
* Control the volumes of different frequencies (ex. bump the bass)
* Create pre-made Equalizer settings and allow for creation of custom ones
* Allowing for the same audio to be played out of both left and right speakers.
* Ability to layer/rearrange tracks
* Ability to trim/re-record sections of an audio file
* Some sort of visualizer that chages with the music
* Ability to add tracks from different sources (ie. Apple Music and Spotify) to the same queue

# Some potentially useful libraries:
* [jmusic](http://explodingart.com/jmusic/) is a music composition tool designed to provide a solid framework for music edition and production.
  * It can read and write MIDI, XML files, audio, and its own .jm files
  * Has a wide range of instruments (electronic synth sounds and regular instruments)
