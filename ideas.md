# Ideas
Add any and all ideas (simple or outlandish) that would make dealing with music and audio in Android apps easier, here!

* Basic play, pause, stop, replay, etc. features
* Ability to select an audio file
* Access to Spotify/Apple Music/etc.
* Scrubbing backwards and forwards through song
* Control the volumes of different frequencies (ex. bump the bass)
* Create pre-made Equalizer settings and allow for creation of custom ones
* Allowing for the same audio to be played out of both left and right speakers.
* Ability to layer/rearrange tracks
* Ability to trim/re-record sections of an audio file
